# Fallout Mods Combined big changes branch

**This is for testing changes that are significant enough to warrant testing, user feedback is appreciated!**

Current idea:

Complete rebalance of gear pool for all legion soldiers, from recruit to veteran legionary, based on Fallout lore and gameplay. Remove all knives from all melee weapons pools. All soldiers will have either a sword, blunt weapon, reach weapon, or unarmed weapon. Firearm pool also rebalanced based on caliber. This affects the combat difficulty of all soldiers when facing them. 

According to Fallout lore and Fallout New Vegas gameplay, as recruit legionaries are viewed as disposable and not expected to survive long in war, they are only given basic makeshift melee weapons. Prime legionaries are the primary fighting force of the legion, so they are either provided better quality makeshift weapons, or looted one. Veteran legionaries are the most experienced soldiers, so they have access to even better quality weapons.

In combining Fallout lore and Cataclysm lore, I decided that since civilization collapsed due to alien invasion instead of nuclear war, plenty of industrial equipment still exists, along with books on blacksmithing techniques. This is unlike the Fallout universe, where except for The Pitt and NCR, there is no industry available. Following the changes, legion blacksmiths are actually capable of reproducing historial medieval weapons for the legionaries who can afford it, and make pipe guns for the recruit legionaries.
