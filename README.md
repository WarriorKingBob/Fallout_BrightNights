# Fallout Mods Combined big changes branch

**This is for testing changes that are significant enough to warrant testing, user feedback is appreciated!**

**Current ideas:**

***Firearm rename and cleanup***

Fallout, being a commercial game, genericized their firearm names possibly to avoid legal issues. This game doesn't have that issue, so I've renamed them to real life counterparts they're based on in line with the base game. I also decided to remove most of the 5.56 rifles, because they're based on AR-15 rifles anyway, and we have enough 5.56 rifles already.

NCR service rifle - Based on M16A1 with wood furniture. I will replace it with M16A4, mainly because M4A1 is dropped enough already, could use more of other 5.56 rifles. Unless you guys want me to keep this.

AC-5 (Assault carbine) and MC-223 (Marksman carbine) - Colt AR-15 derivatives, removed. In their place is M4A1.

.357 Magnum revolver - Renamed to Colt Single Action Army

Brush Gun - Renamed to Winchester 1886

More to add

***Legion gear rebalance***

Complete rebalance of gear pool for all legion soldiers, from recruit to veteran legionary, based on Fallout lore and gameplay. Remove all knives from all melee weapons pools. All soldiers will have either a sword, blunt weapon, reach weapon, or unarmed weapon. Firearm pool also rebalanced based on caliber. This affects the combat difficulty of all soldiers when facing them. 

According to Fallout lore and Fallout New Vegas gameplay, as recruit legionaries are viewed as disposable and not expected to survive long in war, they are only given basic makeshift melee weapons. Prime legionaries are the primary fighting force of the legion, so they are provided better quality makeshift weapons. Veteran legionaries are the most experienced soldiers, so they have access to even better quality weapons.

In combining Fallout lore and Cataclysm lore, I decided that since civilization collapsed due to alien invasion instead of nuclear war, plenty of industrial equipment still exists, along with books on blacksmithing techniques. This is unlike the Fallout universe, where except for The Pitt and NCR, there is no industry available. Following the changes, legion blacksmiths are actually capable of reproducing historial medieval weapons for the legionaries who can afford it.
